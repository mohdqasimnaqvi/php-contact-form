#My Notes of my first business proposal
##1. The title
    - Your name along with your company’s name
    - The name of their business
    - The date you're submitting the proposal
##2. Table of Contents
The table of contents is a fundamental part of every business proposal template. It makes your proposal scannable and easy to read.
    - add hyperlinks to the table of contents
##3. Executive Summary
 It is a concise summary of the entire contents of your document. In other words, a business proposal outline that is easy to glance over.
 ### Goals
- Introduce your company to your buyer
- Provide an overview of your company goals
- Showcase your company’s milestones, overall vision and future plans
- Include any other relevant details
Keep your executive summary concise and clear from the get-go. This sets the right tone for the rest of your proposal
###Pro tip!
Try to write an executive summary such that, even if your prospective client doesn’t read the entire proposal (with a good executive summary, they most likely will), they should have a clear idea about what your company does and how you can help them.
##3. Problem Statement
Your goal is to outline the problem statement as clearly as possible. This develops a sense of urgency in your prospect. They will want to find a solution to the problem. And you have that solution.
This bold business proposal template above clearly outlines the problem at hand and also offers a ray of hope
##4. Propsed solution
In the proposed solution section you show how you can alleviate your prospective buyer’s pain points. This can fit onto the problem statement section but if you have a comprehensive solution or prefer to elaborate on the details, a separate section is a good idea.
##5. Qualifications
 Your job is to convince them that you can fix their problem. This section is important because it acts as social proof. You can highlight what your company does best and how qualified your team is.
###Pro tip!
Attaching in-depth case studies of your work is a great way to build trust with a potential client by showcasing how you’ve solved similar problems for other clients in the past.
##6. Project Timeline
Provide a timeline of how and when you will complete all your deliverables. You can do this by designing a flow chart. Or add a roadmap with deadlines. Pitching a long-term project? A timeline infographic would be a better fit.
##7. Pricing $
The key to good pricing is to provide your buyer with options. A pricing comparison table can help with this. You want to give your client some room to work with. Make sure you’re not scaring off your client with a high price, nor undervaluing yourself.Break up your pricing in stages like: 
1. Discovey -> $10
2. Proposal -> $50
##8. Terms and conditions
Add the overall project timeline from start to end, as well as payment methods and payment schedule. This way, both of you will be clear on what is being agreed on.
 <h2 id="down">9. the acceptance of the Proposal</h2>
 Add a small section at the end of your proposal to get the necessary signatures. This way, you and your client can sign the proposal and the partnership becomes official.
 
 Be sure to also include your contact information in your business proposal template. It acts as a gentle prompt to your client to contact you in case they have any questions.
